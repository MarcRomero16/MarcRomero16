## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a fourth-year Computer Engineering student studying at the University of California, Santa Cruz.  
I'm working toward becoming a Digital Hardware Engineer. I enjoy working on embedded systems, 
designing digital logic, and exploring how hardware and software interact at the lowest levels.
I'm currently a Break Through Tech AI Fellow, where I’ve gained knowledge in machine learning and exposure to real-world AI applications. 
I also serve as the Events Coordinator for my SHPE chapter at UCSC, where I help organize workshops, panels, and networking events to support Latino students in STEM.
I'm very passionate about building impactful technology and uplifting my community along the way.
